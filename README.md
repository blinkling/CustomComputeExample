# CustomComputeExample  
The of the main goals of this project is to provide an example of how to use the RDG to transfer large amounts of data to the GPU.  
The [Wiki](https://github.com/nfgrep/CustomComputeExample/wiki) of this project contains an explaination of the code.  

To demonstrate the use of compute-shaders, the project just colours a texture with the position of the first vertex of a given mesh
